      <p class="first closed">Hey my name is Terry Robinson. I am currently attending the Iron Yard
      to become a Front-End Developer. It's only been 3 weeks into the course
      and these 3 weeks have been really tough but I have been learning bit by
      bit slowly. In a few more weeks I hope to be much better at working with
      JavaScript.</p>

      <p class="second closed">Hey my name is Terry Robinson. I will soon be graduating from Furman
      University and will be moving into the real world. I am taking an Iron
      Yard Front-End Development course to try and futher my learning and give
      me a chance to get a good job. I plan to combine the Iron Yard course
      with my soon to be Communication Studies degree. I hope the combination
      of these two will make me more valuable in the work place.</p>

      <p class="third closed">Hey my name is Terry Robinson. While I do hope the Iron Yard will
      allow me to get a well paying job, what I am really in search of is
      basic knowledge about programming that I can use to begin making my own
      applications. Not only do I want to make applications but since I got my
      first smartphone I have had the goal to one day create my own operating
      system that will work across all devices.</p>
